# POS System (Experimental Project)  

This is an experimental **Point-of-Sale (POS)** system developed to explore modern web development practices. It combines **React (using Vite)** for the front end and **Spring Boot** for the back end, with each part organized into its respective directory.

## 🚀 Features  
- **Frontend**:  
  - Built with **React** and **Vite** for a modern, fast, and interactive user interface.  
  - Designed for responsiveness and scalability.  
- **Backend**:  
  - Developed with **Spring Boot** to deliver robust RESTful APIs.  
  - Secure and efficient architecture for real-world usability.  
- **Modular Codebase**:  
  - Clean separation between front-end and back-end codebases for improved maintainability.
